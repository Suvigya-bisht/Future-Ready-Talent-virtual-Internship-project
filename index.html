    <h2><b>Present Scenario of Mental Health in India</b></h2>
                <hr>
                <p> Mental healthcare in India is a right secured to every person in the country by law. Indian mental health legislation, as per a 2017 study, meets 68% (119/175) of the World Health Organization (WHO) standards laid down in the WHO Checklist of Mental Health Legislation. However, human resources and expertise in the field of mental health in India is significantly low when compared to the population of the country. The allocation of the national healthcare budget to mental health is also low, standing at 0.16%. India's mental health policy was released in 2014. 

    Signs and symptoms of mental illness can vary, depending on the disorder, circumstances and other factors. Mental illness symptoms can affect emotions, thoughts and behaviors.
    Examples of signs and symptoms include:
    Feeling sad or down
    Confused thinking or reduced ability to concentrate
    Excessive fears or worries, or extreme feelings of guilt
    Extreme mood changes of highs and lows
    Withdrawal from friends and activities
    Significant tiredness, low energy or problems sleeping
    Detachment from reality (delusions), paranoia or hallucinations
    Inability to cope with daily problems or stress
    Trouble understanding and relating to situations and to people
    Problems with alcohol or drug use
    Major changes in eating habits
    Sex drive changes
    Excessive anger, hostility or violence
    Suicidal thinking
    Sometimes symptoms of a mental health disorder appear as physical problems, such as stomach pain, back pain, headaches, or other unexplained aches and pains.

    Public interest litigations and judicial intervention, followed by reviews and monitoring of the National Human Rights Commission and National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, coupled with an expansion of facilities for developing human resources in the field of mental healthcare, among other changes, has all positively contributed to the state of mental health and healthcare in the country.

        <h2><b>NOMENCLATURE</b></h2>
        <p>
    Modern psychiatry in the Indian subcontinent dates back to the factories of the East India Company in the 17th century. Mental healthcare in colonial India and the years post-independence was custodial and segregationist. It slowly moved towards a more curative and therapeutic nature by the end of the 20th century. The first asylum was established in Bombay in 1745 and the second at Calcutta in 1784, both only for Europeans. Dr LP Varma, First Assistant Superintendent, Indian Mental Hospital, Ranchi observed in 1953, "The history of Psychiatry in this country is the history of establishment of mental hospitals and then increasing its accommodation from time to time as the exigencies of the time demand"

        <h2><b>SINGS AND SYMPTOMS</b></h2>
      <p>Each illness has its own symptoms, but common signs of mental illness in adults and adolescents can include the following: Excessive worrying or fear, Feeling excessively sad or low, Confused thinking or problems concentrating and learning, Extreme mood changes, including uncontrollable “highs” or feelings of euphoria, Prolonged or strong feelings of irritability or anger, Avoiding friends and social activities, Difficulties understanding or relating to other people, Changes in sleeping habits or feeling tired and low energy, Changes in eating habits such as increased hunger or lack of appetite, Changes in sex drive, Difficulty perceiving reality (delusions or hallucinations, in which a person experiences and senses things that don't exist in objective reality), Inability to perceive changes in one’s own feelings, behavior or personality (”lack of insight” or anosognosia), Overuse of substances like alcohol or drugs, Multiple physical ailments without obvious causes (such as headaches, stomach aches, vague and ongoing “aches and pains”), Thinking about suicide, Inability to carry out daily activities or handle daily problems and stress or An intense fear of weight gain or concern with appearance
            
    Mental health conditions can also begin to develop in young children. Because they’re still learning how to identify and talk about thoughts and emotions, their most obvious symptoms are behavioral. Symptoms in children may include the following: Changes in school performance, Excessive worry or anxiety, for instance fighting to avoid bed or school, Hyperactive behavior, Frequent nightmares, Frequent disobedience or aggression or Frequent temper tantrums
    
    Trying to tell the difference between what expected behaviors are and what might be the signs of a mental illness isn't always easy. There's no easy test that can let someone know if there is mental illness or if actions and thoughts might be typical behaviors of a person or the result of a physical illness
    
    In India, the treatment gap (the number of people with an illness who need treatment but do not get it) is 70 to 92 per cent, depending on the state. It is estimated that nearly one-third of patients who seek help from healthcare facilities could have symptoms related to depression. But poor awareness of mental health symptoms, social stigma, and lack of adequate resources and facilities stop people from getting the help they need.</p>
